# 🌱 ESP32 DIY 1–16 Zone Irrigation Controller

A flexible, locally controlled irrigation system for **1–16 solenoid valves**. It combines per-zone scheduling, weather-aware delays, optional tank/mains switching, sensor support, MQTT, and a responsive web dashboard.

Schedules run on the controller, so watering continues even when the internet is unavailable.

## 🚀 Install from your browser

No Arduino IDE is required. Connect the ESP32 by USB and open the:

### 👉 [ESP32 Irrigation Web Flasher](https://numerik11.github.io/ESP32-Irrigation-Controller/web-flasher/)

</p>

After flashing:

1. Connect to the **ESPIrrigationAP** Wi-Fi network.
2. Open `http://192.168.4.1` and enter your Wi-Fi details.
3. Wait for the controller to restart.
4. Open `http://espirrigation.local` or use the IP address assigned by your router.
5. Configure the zones, GPIO pins, weather location, and schedules.
6. Manually test every output before enabling automatic watering.

## ⏱️ Scheduling and smart watering

Each zone has editable days, two start times, and separate durations. **Sequential mode** runs one valve at a time and suits most systems. **Concurrent mode** can run multiple valves, but only when the transformer, relays, pipework, and water supply can handle the combined load.

With latitude and longitude configured, Open-Meteo can provide temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, rainfall, daily high/low, sunrise, sunset, and current conditions.

Scheduled watering can be blocked by:

- Current rain or an active physical rain sensor
- A configured rainfall threshold
- The after-rain cooldown period
- Excessive wind
- Master OFF or system pause

Manual watering remains available where permitted. Optional temperature and moisture rules can also adjust runtimes for current conditions.

## 💧 Tank and mains control

An optional level sensor can help select between a rainwater tank and mains supply. Available modes include **Auto: Tank**, **Auto: Mains**, **Force Tank**, and **Force Mains**.

> ⚠️ Wiring and available GPIOs vary between boards, relay modules, and irrigation systems. Confirm pin assignments, relay polarity, and voltage requirements before applying power.

## 🖥️ Supported hardware

| Hardware | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ESP32** | Standard development-board installation |
| **ESP32-S3** | Newer ESP32-S3 installation |
| **ESP32 + 240×320 SPI TFT** | Full-colour status display |
| **ESP32 + I²C OLED** | Compact, low-pin-count display |
| **ESP8266 + I²C LCD** | Lightweight LCD controller version |
| **KC868-A6 / A8** | ESP32 relay controllers with screw terminals |

Typical builds use an ESP32 or ESP32-S3, a 4/6/8/16-channel relay module, 1–16 irrigation valves, a suitable 12 or 24 V AC/DC supply, irrigation cable, terminal blocks, fuse protection, and a weatherproof enclosure.

Optional equipment includes tank, rain, soil-moisture, and temperature/humidity sensors; tank and mains valves; and TFT, OLED, or LCD displays. A photoresistor can switch or dim an enclosure display when the door is closed.

### GPIO and relay polarity

GPIOs can be assigned to zone outputs, tank and mains valves, sensors, and displays. Outputs can be configured as **active HIGH** or **active LOW**; many ESP32 relay modules are LOW = ON. GPIO changes may require a reboot.

### KC868

KC868 configurations use PCF8574 I/O expanders with automatic detection, configurable polarity, and GPIO fallback where supported. Default addresses are:

```text
0x24 = Relay outputs
0x22 = Inputs
```

Manual compilation requires the [Kincony PCF8574 library](https://www.kincony.com/forum/attachment.php?aid=1697).

## 🌐 Networking and integration

| Service | Address or hostname |
| --- | --- |
| Setup access point | `ESPIrrigationAP` |
| Setup portal | `http://192.168.4.1` |
| Local dashboard | `http://espirrigation.local/` |
| OTA hostname | `ESP32-Irrigation` |

MQTT supports integrations such as Home Assistant, Node-RED, custom dashboards, and other home-automation systems.

### Web endpoints

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Main dashboard |
| `/setup` | Controller configuration |
| `/status` | JSON system status |
| `/events` | Event log |
| `/tank` | Tank sensor calibration |
| `/download/events.csv` | Download event log |
| `/i2c-test` | I²C/relay test |
| `/stopall` | Stop all active zones |
| `/valve/on/<z>` | Start a zone manually |
| `/valve/off/<z>` | Stop a zone manually |
| `/reboot` | Reboot the controller |

## 🛠️ Manual installation

To compile with Arduino IDE:

1. Add `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json` to **Additional Boards Manager URLs**.
2. Install **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**.
3. Select **ESP32 Dev Module** or **ESP32S3 Dev Module**, as appropriate.
4. Select an OTA-capable partition layout if OTA updates are required. **Huge APP** or **No OTA** can provide more space when OTA is not needed.

> Do not select a **No OTA** partition if you intend to update firmware over the network.

## ⚠️ Electrical safety

- Use a transformer or power supply that matches the valve rating and can support every valve that may run concurrently.
- Never apply more than **3.3 V** directly to an ESP32 GPIO. Use a voltage divider, level converter, or suitable signal-conditioning circuit for 5 V, 10 V, or 0–10 V sensor outputs.
- Solenoids are inductive loads. Use a correctly oriented flyback diode for DC valves. For AC valves, use an appropriately rated MOV or RC snubber—not a DC flyback diode.
- Keep solenoid wiring away from ESP32 and sensor wiring to reduce resets, interference, and electrical noise.
- Enclose, insulate, and protect any mains wiring according to local requirements. Keep it physically separated from low-voltage wiring and use a qualified person where required.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Checks |
| --- | --- |
| ESP32 resets when a valve switches | Check suppression, supply capacity, grounding, relay ratings, and cable separation. |
| Relay operates backwards | Change the output polarity in **Setup**. |
| `espirrigation.local` does not open | Use the IP address shown in your router's connected-device list. |
| Weather does not update | Check internet access, latitude, longitude, timezone, and DNS. Local schedules still operate. |
| Wrong valve activates | Check zone numbering, GPIO assignments, relay wiring, and HIGH/LOW polarity. |
